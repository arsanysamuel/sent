# **sent** - simple plaintext presentation tool.

This is my build of the [suckless sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/), including extra configuration and applied patches.

**sent** does not need latex, libreoffice or any other fancy file format, it uses plaintext files to describe the slides and can also display images. Every paragraph represents a slide in the presentation. Especially for presentations using the [Takahashi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takahashi_method) this is very nice and allows you to write down the presentation for a quick lightning talk within a few minutes.

The presentation is displayed in a simple X11 window colored black on white for maximum contrast even if the sun shines directly onto the projected image. The content of each slide is automatically scaled to fit the window so you don't have to worry about alignment. Instead you can really focus on the content.


## Requirements

- Xlib and Xft for building
- [farbfeld](https://tools.suckless.org/farbfeld/)  tools to use images in the presentations (if you don't want to use farbfeld, sent-0.2 was the last version with just png support, but may lack fixes and further improvements since its release)
You need to install `cairo` in order to use the pdf patch


## Demo

To get a little demo, just type
```
make && ./sent example
```
You can navigate with the arrow keys and quit with q.


## (Non-)Features

- A presentation is just a simple text file.
- Each paragraph represents one slide.
- Content is automatically scaled to fit the screen.
- UTF-8 is supported.
- Images can be displayed (no text on the same slide).
- Just around 1000 lines of C
- No different font styles (bold, italic, underline)
- No fancy layout options (different font sizes, different colors, â€¦)
- No animations
- No support for automatic layouting paragraphs
- No export function. If you really need one, just use a shell script with xdotool and your favorite screenshot application.
- Slides with exuberant amount of lines or characters produce rendering glitches intentionally to prevent you from holding bad presentations.


## Configuration

The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom `config.h` (a copy of `config.def.h`) and (re)compiling the source code.


## Usage

```
sent [FILE]
```
If FILE is omitted or equals -, stdin will be read. Produce image slides by prepending a @ in front of the filename as a single paragraph. Lines starting with # will be ignored. A `\\` at the beginning of the line escapes @ and `#`. A presentation file could look like this:

```
sent

@nyan.png

depends on
- Xlib
- farbfeld

sent FILENAME
one slide per paragraph
# This is a comment and will not be part of the presentation
\# This and the next line start with backslashes

\@FILE.png

```
